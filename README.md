### River's Linux Configs
###### They might work on BSD too idk

- Put a dot before the bashrc and profile ofc
- You can copy the folders (except bin) into your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
- Put the bin file in your home folder and also your `$PATH`
    - The i3blocks config uses a couple of them
    - And the tmux alias in the bashrc
    - Also many of the scripts use rofi so install that yeah
- kthxbye
